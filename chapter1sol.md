# Chapter Two - Operations

## Notes

1. An operation (*) is defined for every ordered pair (a,b) of elements of A
2. a*b must be uniquely defined
3. if a and b are in A, then a*b must be in A

## A. Examples of Operations
which of the following rules are operations on the indicated set?

1. $a*b = \sqrt{|ab| }$ , on the set $\mathbb{Q}$  
solution: Not an operation. Closure does not hold.
for example $2*1 = \sqrt{2} \not\in \mathbb{Q}$
